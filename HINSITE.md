## 2026-02-10 - Phase 0 scaffold (Tauri + React + Rust workspace)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Scaffolded the repo into the required structure (`src/`, `src-tauri/`, `crates/qir_core/`, `crates/qir_ai/`, `migrations/`, `fixtures/`) so we can iterate with deterministic verification gates.
- Added canonical scripts so required verification commands exist and are repeatable.
- Added minimal Rust crates (`qir_core`, `qir_ai`) and a minimal Tauri shell to ensure `pnpm tauri build` and `cargo test -p ...` work early.

3) Verification: commands run + results

- `pnpm lint` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

Note: `pnpm approve-builds` was needed once to allow `esbuild` install scripts (pnpm security feature) so Vite could build.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` currently sets `csp: null`. We should tighten CSP once we know needed allowances for local UI behavior.
- The temporary `_scaffold/` directory exists locally but is ignored via /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/.gitignore due to exec-policy restrictions on `rm -rf`.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Phase 0: complete.
- Phase 1: next (schema/migrations, ingest, validators, deterministic metrics in `crates/qir_core`).

6) Next steps
- Implement SQLite schema + migration runner in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core and add the first migration under /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/migrations/.
- Add deterministic ingest stubs (Jira CSV + Slack transcript) and validators with fixtures and tests.
- Wire minimal Tauri commands for DB init and import (thin wrappers only).

---

## 2026-02-10 - Phase 1.1 DB schema + migration runner (qir_core)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added the initial SQLite schema in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/migrations/0001_init.sql with nullable canonical timestamps and uniqueness constraints for dedupe (external_id preferred, otherwise fingerprint).
- Implemented a deterministic migration runner in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/db/mod.rs that applies migrations exactly once and surfaces errors with explicit codes/messages (no silent failure).

2) Files changed
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/migrations/0001_init.sql

- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/lib.rs

3) Verification: commands run + results

- `pnpm test` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- `migrations/0001_init.sql` stores timestamps as TEXT; we should validate/normalize ingestion into a canonical ISO-8601 format and keep ordering checks in validators.
- Schema will evolve; future migrations must preserve deterministic report ordering (stable sorts) and avoid destructive defaults.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Phase 1: in progress (ingest + validators + metrics next).

6) Next steps
- Add domain types + deterministic fingerprinting in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core and implement ingesters (Jira CSV + Slack transcript).
- Implement validators for timestamp ordering and percent field ranges with fixture-backed tests.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Phase 1.2 Jira CSV ingest (qir_core)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added domain types for incidents and validation warnings in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/domain/mod.rs.
- Implemented Jira CSV ingest with explicit mapping in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/ingest/jira_csv.rs:
  - no silent defaults (missing titles become warnings and rows are skipped)
  - percent fields validate 0..100 with warnings on failures
  - deterministic fingerprinting to support dedupe rules
- Added a sanitized CSV fixture and an integration test to ensure ingest works end-to-end against an in-memory migrated DB.

2) Files changed
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/Cargo.toml
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/lib.rs

3) Verification: commands run + results
- `pnpm lint` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `pnpm test` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `cargo test -p qir_core` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Timestamp parsing/normalization is not implemented yet; ingest currently stores timestamp strings as-is and validators must flag ordering/format anomalies.
- The current behavior returns an error on any DB insert failure (including uniqueness conflicts). We should enrich this to surface conflicts as structured ingest results instead of a single fatal error.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Phase 1: in progress (Slack ingest + validators + deterministic metrics next).

6) Next steps
- Implement Slack transcript ingest in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/ingest/.
- Implement validators (timestamp ordering + percent ranges + dedupe conflict surfacing) and tests with sanitized fixtures.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Phase 1.3 Validators + deterministic per-incident metrics (qir_core)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented validator logic in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/validate/mod.rs:
  - RFC3339 timestamp parsing warnings (no silent parse failures)
  - strict ordering checks: `start <= first_observed <= it_awareness <= ack <= mitigate <= resolve` (when present)
  - percent range warnings (nullable 0..100)
- Implemented deterministic per-incident metrics in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/metrics/mod.rs:
  - metrics are computed only when required timestamps are present and parseable
  - ordering violations produce warnings and result in `None` metrics (no silent correction)
- Added fixture-backed tests for validation and metrics behavior.

2) Files changed
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/Cargo.toml
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/lib.rs
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/validate/mod.rs
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/metrics/mod.rs
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/tests/validate_and_metrics.rs

3) Verification: commands run + results
- `pnpm lint` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `pnpm test` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `cargo test -p qir_core` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Timestamp parsing currently only supports RFC3339. Jira/Slack exports often contain other formats; ingestion should normalize into RFC3339 or emit explicit warnings when unknown.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Phase 1: in progress (Slack ingest + DB repos + rollups + analytics payloads next).

6) Next steps
- Implement Slack transcript ingest into `timeline_events` and add sanitized fixtures/tests.
- Add DB repository helpers for listing incidents and attaching validation+metrics results.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Phase 1.4 Slack transcript ingest + basic DB repo helpers (qir_core)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added Slack transcript ingestion in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/ingest/slack_transcript.rs that:
  - ingests each line into `timeline_events`
  - parses RFC3339 timestamps when present and warns explicitly when missing (no silent defaults)
- Added DB repository helpers in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/repo/mod.rs to list/count incidents (foundation for dashboards and reporting).
- Added sanitized Slack fixture + tests for transcript ingestion.

2) Files changed
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/lib.rs

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Slack parsing is intentionally minimal (line-oriented). We should extend to support common Slack export formats (JSON export, “copy from Slack” formats) with explicit warnings when unknown.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Phase 1: in progress (rollups/analytics payloads + report generation next).

6) Next steps
- Implement analytics payloads in `qir_core` (versioned) and wire them through `src-tauri` to the frontend for ECharts dashboards.
- Implement deterministic Markdown report generator + golden snapshot tests.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Phases 2-4 Dashboard + report + thin Tauri RPC + UI wiring

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added versioned analytics payloads and dashboard dataset builder in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/analytics/mod.rs so the frontend can render ECharts charts without computing metrics.
- Added deterministic Markdown report generation in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/report/mod.rs with golden snapshot test coverage.
- Wired thin Tauri commands in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src-tauri/src/lib.rs:
  - `init_db` (migrate DB in app data dir)
  - `seed_demo_jira` (ingest sanitized Jira CSV fixture)
  - `get_dashboard_v1` (returns versioned analytics payload)
  - `generate_report_md` (returns Markdown)
- Implemented a basic React UI in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/App.tsx to call commands, show ECharts severity chart, drill-down incident table, and display report Markdown.
- Added runtime validation (Zod schemas) for command results (typed payload contracts).

2) Files changed

3) Verification: commands run + results

- `pnpm test` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Frontend bundle size is large due to ECharts; later we should add code-splitting (dynamic import) to keep initial load lighter.
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` CSP is still `null`; we should tighten once UI feature-set stabilizes.
- The app currently provides a demo seed and basic dashboard/report, but does not yet expose full import UX (file pickers, mapping UI persistence) or backup/restore flows.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Phase 2: in progress (more dashboards + richer drill-down + reconciliation).
- Phase 3: in progress (report sections beyond the minimal demo).
- Phase 4: in progress (typed payload validation exists; expand commands and UI error details).
- Phase 5: not started (AI must remain gated until evidence store exists and core is solid).

6) Next steps
- Add saved mapping profiles + Jira import UI (export-based) and wire through Tauri using typed payloads + runtime validation.
- Implement backup/restore and sanitized export flows (local-only) and add fixtures/tests.
- After evidence store exists, start `crates/qir_ai` with Ollama health checks and citation enforcement endpoints.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Phase 5 (partial) Local AI foundations (qir_ai) + health check wiring

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented local-only Ollama client health check in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_ai/src/ollama.rs enforcing `127.0.0.1` base URLs (no remote AI).
- Implemented a file-based evidence chunk store in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_ai/src/evidence.rs so AI features can be evidence-backed without adding DB schema/migrations outside `qir_core`.
- Implemented citation enforcement guardrail in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_ai/src/guardrails.rs (hard fail `AI_CITATION_REQUIRED` if missing citations).
- Wired a thin Tauri command `ai_health_check` in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src-tauri/src/lib.rs and exposed it in the UI.

2) Files changed

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Ollama API surface is not yet used for drafting; only health checks are implemented. Draft endpoints must enforce citations against stored evidence chunks and must never compute deterministic metrics/timestamps.
- Evidence store currently doesn’t implement chunking/embeddings/similarity search yet; those are next within `qir_ai`.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Phase 5: in progress (foundations + guardrails in place; drafting/indexing not implemented yet).

6) Next steps
- Implement deterministic chunking + embeddings + similarity search in `qir_ai` and expose evidence index build via thin Tauri commands.
- Add AI drafting endpoints that hard-require citations and return `UNKNOWN` where evidence is insufficient.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Deliverable Set 1 (part 1) Mapping profiles + Jira import engine (qir_core)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented Jira mapping profile persistence in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/profiles/jira.rs (CRUD over the existing `jira_mapping_profiles` table).
- Implemented Jira CSV preview parsing in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/ingest/jira_csv.rs to power a mapping UI (headers + sample rows).
- Reworked Jira CSV ingestion into an import engine that returns deterministic results:
  - counts: inserted / updated / skipped
  - conflicts surfaced explicitly (no silent merges)
  - warnings include non-RFC3339 timestamp parse warnings while preserving raw strings
- Added sanitized fixtures and integration tests covering:
  - profile persistence CRUD
  - mapping-driven import correctness
  - conflict surfacing for duplicate external IDs
  - warnings for non-RFC3339 timestamps

2) Files changed
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/lib.rs
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/profiles/mod.rs

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Constraint conflict detection currently treats any SQLite constraint violation as a conflict to surface; if we later need more granular messaging, we can inspect extended error codes.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 1: in progress (Tauri commands + frontend mapping/import UX next).

6) Next steps
- Add thin Tauri commands for mapping profile CRUD + CSV preview + import using selected profile.
- Implement frontend Jira import UI: file picker, mapping UI with preview, save/reuse profiles, and result rendering for inserted/updated/skipped/warnings/conflicts.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Deliverable Set 1 (part 2) Thin Tauri commands + initial Jira import UI

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added thin Tauri commands in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src-tauri/src/lib.rs for:
  - `jira_csv_preview` (headers + sample rows)
  - `jira_profiles_list`, `jira_profiles_upsert`, `jira_profiles_delete` (mapping profile CRUD)
  - `jira_import_using_profile` (import Jira CSV using selected profile)
- Updated the frontend to provide an export-based Jira CSV import UX in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/App.tsx:
  - file picker (`<input type="file">`)
  - CSV preview table
  - mapping UI with explicit required/optional labels
  - profile save/reuse/delete
  - import results (inserted/updated/skipped + warnings + conflicts)
- Updated schemas in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/lib/schemas.ts so all command payloads are runtime validated (typed contracts).

2) Files changed
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src-tauri/src/lib.rs
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/App.tsx
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/styles.css
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/lib/schemas.ts

3) Verification: commands run + results
- `pnpm lint` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `pnpm test` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `cargo test -p qir_core` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- The UI currently requires saving/selecting a profile before importing (explicit workflow). If we want “import without saving”, we can add a separate command that takes a mapping directly, but that is not required for Deliverable Set 1.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 1: in progress (finish: ensure import result UX includes updated/skipped semantics, and ensure tests cover profile persistence + mapping application + conflict surfacing end-to-end).

6) Next steps
- Add an end-to-end test that saves a profile then imports using that profile to ensure profile persistence integrates with import.
- Add an update vs skip fixture to validate `updated` and `skipped` counters deterministically.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Deliverable Set 1 (part 3) Update/skip semantics + integration coverage (qir_core)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added integration test coverage in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/tests/jira_profiles_and_import.rs for:
  - updating an existing incident by `external_id` (counts as `updated`)
  - skipping when no changes are detected (counts as `skipped`)
  - using a persisted mapping profile as the source of truth for import mapping
- This completes the required test surface for Deliverable Set 1: profile persistence, mapping correctness, and conflict surfacing.

2) Files changed
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/tests/jira_profiles_and_import.rs

3) Verification: commands run + results

- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- None blocking Deliverable Set 1. Remaining work is higher-level UX polish and expanding import format support.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 1: complete.

6) Next steps
- Add a dedicated “Import” screen (separate from dashboards) and improve result rendering (group warnings by row/field).
- Persist last-used profile selection in local app state to reduce repeated setup.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Jira update semantics: preserve-on-empty (binding decision)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Updated Jira import update behavior in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/ingest/jira_csv.rs to enforce **PRESERVE-ON-EMPTY** semantics:
  - empty/missing CSV cells do **not** overwrite existing stored values with NULL
  - updates now merge incoming non-empty values into the existing record deterministically
- Updated tests in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/tests/jira_profiles_and_import.rs to encode this behavior.

2) Files changed
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/ingest/jira_csv.rs

- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- None identified for this change-set; preserve-on-empty reduces accidental data loss during repeated imports.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 2: not started yet (next).

6) Next steps
- Implement timestamp raw preservation via migration (either *_raw columns or a raw table) and update validators to surface parse failures with raw retention.
- Implement Slack import UX + backend commands + fixtures/tests.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Deliverable Set 2 foundations: timestamp raw preservation + validation report

1) Done: what changed + why
- Wired the existing migration /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/migrations/0002_add_timestamp_raw_columns.sql into the deterministic migration runner so timestamp raw preservation is applied consistently for both on-disk and in-memory DBs.
- Extended the incident domain model to include `*_ts_raw` fields and updated incident listing queries to read them, enabling “preserve raw + surface warnings” behavior without silent defaults.
- Added deterministic, allowlist-only timestamp normalization helpers in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/normalize/timestamps.rs (no fuzzy parsing). This supports the DS2 contract: canonical RFC3339 UTC when deterministically parseable; otherwise preserve raw + explicit warnings.
- Enhanced validators to surface raw timestamp anomalies per field and added a deterministic “validate all incidents” report function to support the upcoming Validation/Anomalies UI.

2) Files changed

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Timestamp normalization currently only allowlists a small set of timezone-less formats (assuming UTC with explicit warnings). We may need to expand the allowlist for Jira-export-specific formats, but we will not add fuzzy parsing.
- Jira ingest still needs to be updated to actually *use* the new normalization helpers and store raw timestamps into `*_ts_raw` (next change-set).

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 2: in progress (timestamp contract foundations done; Slack UX + anomaly UI next).

6) Next steps
- Update Jira ingest to use deterministic timestamp normalization and persist `*_ts_raw` while keeping preserve-on-empty semantics.
- Implement Slack ingest backend (format detection + incident attach/create shell) and expose thin Tauri commands.
- Implement Validation/Anomalies UI and Slack Import UI in the frontend using typed payload contracts.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Jira ingest updated for timestamp normalization + raw preservation

1) Done: what changed + why
- Updated Jira CSV import in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/ingest/jira_csv.rs to enforce the DS2 timestamp contract:
  - canonical incident timestamp columns (`*_ts`) are now RFC3339-only (UTC)
  - non-RFC3339 or unparseable timestamp inputs are preserved deterministically in `*_ts_raw`
  - explicit warnings are emitted for normalization, timezone assumptions, and unparseable values (no silent defaults)
- Extended preserve-on-empty merge logic for timestamp fields by adding a “provided vs not provided” distinction so that:
  - missing/empty CSV cells do not overwrite either canonical or raw values
  - provided values can intentionally clear `*_ts_raw` (e.g., when replaced with RFC3339)
- Updated tests to assert canonical NULL + raw preserved for non-RFC3339 fixtures.

2) Files changed
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/ingest/jira_csv.rs
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/tests/jira_profiles_and_import.rs

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- The deterministic timestamp allowlist intentionally does not parse ambiguous locale formats like `MM/DD/YYYY ...`; those values will remain raw-only with warnings.
- We may need to expand the allowlist for Jira-export-specific formats (e.g., offset forms) later, but we will not add fuzzy parsing.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 2: in progress (timestamp contract implemented for Jira ingest; Slack ingest UX + anomaly UI next).

6) Next steps
- Implement Slack ingest backend (format detection + incident attach/create shell) and expose thin Tauri commands.
- Add a Validation/Anomalies view in the frontend backed by `qir_core`’s validation report payload.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Slack ingest backend (export-based) + thin Tauri commands (DS2)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented Slack transcript format detection + deterministic ingest in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/ingest/slack_transcript.rs:
  - Supported formats:
    - line-oriented RFC3339 transcript (`line_rfc3339`)
    - Slack JSON export array (`slack_json_export`) with deterministic Slack `ts` conversion (no float parsing)
    - unknown formats fall back to raw line ingestion with explicit warnings (no guessing timestamps)
  - Ingest now attaches events to a chosen incident OR creates a new “Slack-only incident shell” deterministically (title required; no silent defaults).
- Added sanitized fixtures for JSON export + paste-style transcript and expanded tests to cover:
  - event creation
  - warning emission for missing/unparseable timestamps
  - incident attachment behavior
- Added thin Tauri commands in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src-tauri/src/lib.rs for:
  - `slack_preview`
  - `slack_ingest`
  - `incidents_list` (for incident selection in UI)
  - `validation_report` (for upcoming anomaly UI)
- Added typed Zod schemas in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/lib/schemas.ts for the new payloads.

2) Files changed

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Slack JSON export formats can vary (per-channel files, different fields). Current implementation targets a deterministic subset: JSON arrays containing objects with `text` and optional `ts`/`user`.
- The UI still needs to expose the Slack import flow and the Validation/Anomalies view (next change-set).

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 2: in progress (Slack ingest backend + commands complete; UI + validation screen next).

6) Next steps
- Implement Slack Import UI (file picker + paste box + incident select/create) calling `slack_preview` and `slack_ingest`.
- Implement Validation/Anomalies UI calling `validation_report` with drill-down to incidents.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Deliverable Set 2 complete: Slack Import UI + Validation UI + timestamp contract tests

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented the DS2 frontend UX in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/App.tsx:
  - Slack Import flow with both file picker and paste box
  - attach transcript to an existing incident or create a new Slack-only incident shell (title required)
  - preview (detected format + counts + warnings) and ingest result rendering (counts + warnings)
  - Validation/Anomalies view that lists incidents with validator warnings and allows filtering the incidents drill-down table by incident id
- Added a second deterministic timestamp normalization fixture + test so the contract is covered for:
  - allowlisted, timezone-less formats (assume UTC with explicit warning)
  - raw preservation for non-RFC3339 inputs
- Updated /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/PLANS.md progress notes to reflect DS2 status.

2) Files changed
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/App.tsx
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/fixtures/demo/jira_allowlisted_ts.csv
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/tests/jira_profiles_and_import.rs
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/PLANS.md

3) Verification: commands run + results
- `pnpm lint` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Validation view currently surfaces `qir_core` validator warnings only; ingest-time warnings are only shown at import time (not persisted). This is acceptable for DS2 but may be worth improving later.
- Slack JSON exports can vary; current parser supports deterministic JSON arrays with `text` and optional `ts`/`user`.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 2: complete.

6) Next steps
- Decide the next milestone (likely Deliverable Set 3: dashboards expansion + deterministic report polishing, or backup/restore/export workflows).
- Add an “Incident detail” view to complement the incidents table and the validation list.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS3 change-set 1: Deterministic storytelling analytics + report v1 expansion

1) Done: what changed + why
- Hardened and finalized the versioned analytics payload `DashboardPayloadV2` in `crates/qir_core` so DS3 dashboards can render from deterministic backend datasets only (no UI metric computation).
- Expanded the deterministic Markdown report generator to include executive summary, metrics distribution table, detection/response/vendor sections, stable incident table ordering, and an explicit validation/anomalies appendix.
- Updated the golden snapshot fixture + tests so report output stays stable and reproducible.
- Fixed the incident drill-down table UI columns to align with the V2 payload (show awareness lag + time to mitigate instead of MTTA).

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- “Weighted pain” is currently computed as `impact_pct × degradation_pct × duration_seconds` (integer). This is deterministic and matches the documented formula shape, but the unit scale is large; we may later normalize to minutes or hours for more readable chart axes.
- The DS3 dashboards UI still needs a clearer navigation structure so Dashboards and Report are first-class sections (next change-set).
- Consider adding an incident detail drawer for richer drill-down context (timeline events + artifacts) without pushing logic into the UI.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 3: in progress (backend datasets + report expanded and golden-tested; UI dashboards + incident detail next).

6) Next steps
- Implement DS3 dashboard pages (Detection/Vendor-Service/Response) in the UI using `get_dashboard_v2`, with click-to-filter drill-down backed by `incident_ids`.
- Add a minimal incident detail view/drawer wired through Tauri to `qir_core` so drill-down is more informative without UI-side computation.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS3 start: story fields in schema + Jira ingest mapping support

1) Done: what changed + why
- Started Deliverable Set 3 by adding optional incident fields needed for storytelling dashboards and report polish:
  - `detection_source`
  - `vendor`
  - `service`
- Implemented these as nullable SQLite columns via /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/migrations/0003_add_story_fields.sql and wired the migration into the deterministic runner in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/db/mod.rs.
- Extended Jira CSV mapping/import in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/ingest/jira_csv.rs to map these fields (optional) with preserve-on-empty semantics (no silent defaults).
- Updated domain and repo query shape so dashboards/reporting can read the new fields deterministically.
- Updated /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/PLANS.md to mark DS2 complete and DS3 in progress.

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- The frontend Jira mapping UI has not yet been expanded to include these new optional mappings; dashboards can still render UNKNOWN buckets until we add those mapping fields to the UI (next change-set).

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 3: in progress (schema + ingest foundations complete; analytics payloads + dashboards + report expansion next).

6) Next steps
- Implement versioned analytics payload(s) for Detection/Response/Vendor-Service stories in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/analytics and add reconciliation + drill-down tests.
- Expand the frontend dashboards UI to render the new payloads via ECharts and support drill-down to backing incidents.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS3 analytics: DashboardPayloadV2 (Detection/Response/Vendor-Service)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented a new versioned analytics payload `DashboardPayloadV2` in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/analytics/mod.rs to support three storytelling dashboards required by DS3:
  - Detection story: detection source mix + IT awareness lag distribution
  - Vendor/service reliability: top vendors/services by incident count + weighted pain (impact × degradation × duration) where available
  - Response story: time to mitigation + time to resolve distributions
- Ensured every chart dataset reconciles to the incident total by including explicit `UNKNOWN` (and `OTHER` where needed) buckets and providing `incident_ids` for drill-down (backend-owned query keys via stable `key` strings).
- Added a sanitized story fixture /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/fixtures/demo/jira_story.csv and an integration test /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/tests/analytics_v2.rs that asserts:
  - bucket counts sum to total incidents
  - union of drill-down incident ids covers the full incident set deterministically

2) Files changed
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/analytics/mod.rs
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/fixtures/demo/jira_story.csv

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- The UI still uses DashboardPayloadV1; next change-set will wire DashboardPayloadV2 through thin Tauri commands + ECharts UI with drill-down.
- Pain calculations intentionally ignore incidents without the needed deterministic inputs; buckets still include all incident ids so drill-down is complete even when pain is partially unknown.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 3: in progress (analytics payloads implemented; UI + report expansion next).

6) Next steps
- Add a new Tauri command (thin) to fetch DashboardPayloadV2 and update the frontend to render the Detection/Response/Vendor-Service dashboards with drill-down.
- Expand the deterministic Markdown report generator to QIR Report v1 using the same backend payloads + a validation appendix, and update golden snapshot tests.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS3 dashboards wired: Tauri get_dashboard_v2 + ECharts story UI + drill-down

1) Done: what changed + why
- Wired the new analytics payload through the thin Tauri layer:
  - Added `get_dashboard_v2` command in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src-tauri/src/lib.rs returning `DashboardPayloadV2` from `qir_core`.
- Updated frontend typed contracts and UI to render the DS3 storytelling dashboards from backend payloads only (no UI metric computation):
  - Added Zod schemas for DashboardPayloadV2 and story buckets in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/lib/schemas.ts.
  - Updated /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/App.tsx to:
    - load DashboardPayloadV2
    - render Detection story, Response story, and Vendor/Service reliability charts via ECharts
    - support drill-down by applying backend-provided `incident_ids` to filter the incident list deterministically
    - add a minimal “Jump To” nav so Dashboards/Report aren’t buried
- Expanded Jira mapping UI in /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/App.tsx to include optional fields `detection_source`, `vendor`, and `service` so exports can populate story dashboards without manual DB edits.

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- The current “pain” chart uses a raw pain unit (impact * degradation * duration_seconds). We may want to add a friendly scaling (e.g., hours) later, but the deterministic drill-down remains correct now.
- Report generator still uses the older minimal report; next change-set will expand it to QIR Report v1 and update golden fixtures.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 3: in progress (dashboards done; report expansion + golden tests next).

6) Next steps
- Expand /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_core/src/report/mod.rs to deterministic QIR Report v1:
  - executive summary, metrics summary tables, incidents table, detection/response highlights, and validation appendix
- Update /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/fixtures/golden/qir_report_demo.md and snapshot tests to match the new deterministic output.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS3 UX polish: Incident detail drawer + schema contract cleanup (restore tauri build)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Completed the DS3 drill-down UX by adding an Incident Detail drawer that loads deterministic detail payloads from the backend (no UI metric computation):
  - Uses existing thin Tauri command `incident_detail` (already wired) and validates the response at the boundary with Zod.
  - Shows computed metrics (formatted), validation/anomaly warnings, timeline events, and artifacts for the selected incident.
- Fixed a build-blocking contract issue introduced during the interrupted edit:
  - Removed duplicate TypeScript/Zod schema declarations for `IncidentMetricsSchema` and `IncidentDetailSchema` to keep schemas single-source and ensure `pnpm tauri build` stays green.

2) Files changed
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/App.tsx
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/lib/schemas.ts
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/PLANS.md

3) Verification: commands run + results
- `pnpm lint` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md; script source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json) -> OK
- `pnpm test` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md; script source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json) -> OK

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- The incident detail drawer currently focuses on read-only visibility. If we later add editing, we should keep all deterministic derivations in `crates/qir_core` and treat UI edits as explicit user actions.
- The Vite build warns about large chunks (not a correctness issue). We can consider code-splitting later if startup performance becomes a concern.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 3: complete (dashboards + deterministic report + drill-down UX + full verification green).

6) Next steps
- Confirm the next milestone (likely backup/restore + sanitized export + demo dataset tooling), keeping AI features gated.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS4 foundation: qir_core backup/restore core + tests (folder export, manifest, integrity)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented deterministic, local-only backup + restore primitives in `crates/qir_core`:
  - Backup creates a folder `IncidentReviewBackup_<timestamp>/` containing:
    - `incidentreview.sqlite` (SQLite snapshot via rusqlite backup API)
    - `manifest.json` (app version, export time, applied migrations, row counts, DB hash; optional artifacts hash list)
    - `artifacts/` is included only if an on-disk artifacts directory exists (not required for current app usage).
  - Restore validates `manifest.json` integrity (DB SHA-256) and requires explicit overwrite confirmation (`allow_overwrite=true`) before swapping the target DB into place.
- Added `qir_core` tests to ensure backup folder contents and restore behavior are correct and auditable.
- Updated `PLANS.md` to mark DS4 as in progress.

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Restore currently keeps a `*.pre_restore` copy of the previous DB (safety-first). We may later add a UI affordance to delete old pre-restore copies explicitly.
- Artifacts directory backup/restore is implemented generically; the app does not yet heavily use on-disk artifacts, so we should confirm the desired artifacts-on-disk strategy before relying on it.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 4: in progress (core backup/restore done; still need Tauri/UI wiring, sanitized export, and demo dataset tooling).

6) Next steps
- Add thin Tauri commands for backup/restore + a simple UI flow that picks directories, previews manifests, and requires explicit confirmation before overwrite.
- Implement deterministic sanitized export (JSON/CSV) with pseudonymization + tests proving no raw Slack text leaks.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS4 wiring: Tauri backup/restore commands + UI directory picker + explicit overwrite confirmation

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added thin Tauri commands that wrap the new `qir_core` backup/restore primitives:
  - `backup_create(destination_dir)` -> creates a human-auditable backup folder (DB snapshot + manifest).
  - `backup_inspect(backup_dir)` -> reads and returns the manifest for UI preview.
  - `restore_from_backup(backup_dir, allow_overwrite)` -> validates manifest integrity and swaps DB into place only when overwrite is explicitly confirmed.
- Implemented a minimal UI flow for backup/restore:
  - Uses a native directory picker (Tauri dialog plugin) to select destination/backup folders.
  - Shows manifest preview (counts/export time/app version) before restore.
  - Requires an explicit “I understand this will overwrite…” checkbox before restore.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Backup/restore UI currently focuses on correctness and explicit confirmation. If we later add “dry-run restore”, it should remain a thin wrapper over `qir_core` integrity checks (no UI-side assumptions).
- Adding the dialog plugin introduces additional build-time dependencies (still local-only at runtime). This was chosen to satisfy the “user-chosen directory” requirement without requiring users to type paths.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 4: in progress (backup/restore wired; still need sanitized export + demo dataset tooling + git hygiene completion).

6) Next steps
- Implement deterministic sanitized export (JSON/CSV) with stable pseudonymization + tests proving no raw Slack text leaks.
- Improve “Seed Demo Dataset” to generate a richer, sanitized dataset for dashboards/reports (no real incident data).

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS4 sanitized export + demo dataset tooling: deterministic shareable exports (no Slack text)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented deterministic “Export Sanitized Dataset” in `crates/qir_core`:
  - Exports a shareable folder `IncidentReviewSanitized_<timestamp>/` containing JSON files (`incidents.json`, `timeline_events.json`, `warnings.json`) plus `sanitized_manifest.json`.
  - Redacts free-text (Slack message text is never exported; timeline events carry `text_redacted=true` only).
  - Pseudonymizes vendor/service/detection_source deterministically (stable across runs for the same input DB).
  - Preserves numeric/timestamp/taxonomy fields so dashboards still tell a story.
- Added tests proving:
  - sanitized output does not contain raw Slack message text
  - pseudonymization is stable across runs
- Implemented a richer “Seed Demo Dataset” in `crates/qir_core` (40 sanitized incidents with realistic distributions).
- Wired sanitized export + demo seed into Tauri commands and exposed both as clear UI actions.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Sanitized export currently produces JSON only (transparent and GitHub-safe). If we later add an “import sanitized dataset” flow, keep it deterministic and owned by `qir_core`.
- Pseudonymization mappings are deterministic but intentionally lossy; this is expected for shareable datasets.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 4: in progress (features implemented; still need git hygiene finalization: DS4 completion commit + ds4 tag + clean status + PLANS update).

6) Next steps
- Finalize git hygiene: commit DS4 completion, create `ds4_complete` tag, ensure `git status` clean.
- Update `PLANS.md` to mark DS4 complete.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS4 completion: plan update + final verification + git hygiene (commit + tag)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Marked DS4 complete in `PLANS.md` and ran the full verification suite to confirm backup/restore + sanitized export + demo tooling remain green.
- Git hygiene:
  - Repository has commits (root baseline commit already exists).
  - DS4 completion is committed and tagged locally as `ds4_complete` (with `ds1_complete`, `ds2_complete`, `ds3_complete` already present).
  - Ensured the working tree is clean at milestone end.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- None for DS4 correctness. Future work should keep AI gated and maintain deterministic boundaries for any export/import flows.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 4: complete.

6) Next steps
- Pick DS5 milestone (likely backup/restore UX polish, sanitized export import, or demo dataset export workflows), keeping all deterministic boundaries intact.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS5 (in progress): qir_core sanitized dataset import primitives + plan update

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented deterministic sanitized dataset import in `crates/qir_core` to complement DS4 sanitized export:
  - Reads and validates `sanitized_manifest.json` (requires `manifest_version == 1`).
  - Verifies SHA-256 hashes and byte sizes for all files listed in the manifest (hard fail on mismatch).
  - Refuses import into non-empty DB (`INGEST_SANITIZED_DB_NOT_EMPTY`).
  - Inserts incidents in sorted `incident_key` order and uses `export_time` from the manifest for deterministic `ingested_at` / `created_at`.
  - Uses deterministic redaction placeholders for NOT NULL fields:
    - `incidents.title = "Incident <incident_key>"`
    - `timeline_events.text = "[REDACTED]"` plus `raw_json={"text_redacted":true}` as an explicit redaction marker.
  - Recomputes deterministic metrics from imported timestamps and hard-fails on mismatch (`INGEST_SANITIZED_METRICS_MISMATCH`).
  - Reconciles warnings non-fatally: surfaces `INGEST_SANITIZED_WARNINGS_MISMATCH` as an import warning when validator output differs from `warnings.json`.
- Updated `PLANS.md` to mark Deliverable Set 5 as in progress.

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Warning reconciliation is intentionally non-fatal in DS5; mismatches are surfaced as an import warning for visibility without blocking app usage.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 5: in progress.

6) Next steps
- Add deterministic round-trip tests (seed demo -> sanitized export -> import into fresh DB -> dashboards/report/validation succeed).
- Wire thin Tauri RPC commands for inspect/import and add a UI flow to import a sanitized dataset folder.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS5 (in progress): deterministic sanitized export/import round-trip tests

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added a deterministic round-trip test in `crates/qir_core` that proves the DS5 import contract works end-to-end:
  - Seed demo dataset -> ingest a Slack event containing a unique sensitive marker -> export sanitized dataset -> import into a fresh DB.
  - Confirms analytics payloads reconcile to incident totals and report generation succeeds after import.
  - Defense-in-depth: asserts the sensitive marker does not appear in exported JSON nor in the imported DB.

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- None identified for correctness. If the demo seed shape changes later, this test should be updated to assert invariants (counts/reconciliation) rather than brittle exact strings.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 5: in progress.

6) Next steps
- Add thin Tauri commands for sanitized dataset inspect/import (no business logic in `src-tauri`).
- Add a UI flow to pick a dataset folder, preview the manifest, run import, and refresh dashboards/report/validation.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS5 (in progress): thin Tauri commands for sanitized dataset inspect/import

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added thin Tauri commands in `src-tauri` that wrap the new deterministic `qir_core` sanitized import functionality:
  - `inspect_sanitized_dataset(dataset_dir)` -> returns `SanitizedExportManifest` for UI preview and validates manifest integrity (including hashes/sizes).
  - `import_sanitized_dataset(dataset_dir)` -> runs deterministic import into the app DB (refuses non-empty DB; metrics cross-check enforced by `qir_core`).
- Kept `src-tauri` as a thin RPC layer only (no import business logic).

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- None identified for DS5 correctness. UI still needs to surface “DB not empty” errors clearly with guidance to restore/seed into a fresh DB first.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 5: in progress.

6) Next steps
- Add UI flow for sanitized dataset import: directory picker, manifest preview, import trigger + results display, and refresh existing views by re-calling commands.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS5 (in progress): UI flow for sanitized dataset import (preview + import + refresh)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added a deterministic “Import Sanitized Dataset” UI flow:
  - Directory picker to select a sanitized dataset export folder.
  - Manifest preview via `inspect_sanitized_dataset` (manifest version + incident count + file list).
  - Import trigger via `import_sanitized_dataset` and results display (insert counts + explicit import warnings).
  - Refreshes incident list, dashboards, report, and validation views by re-calling existing commands (UI remains render-only).
- Surfaced intentional redaction in incident detail timeline events: `(redacted)` is shown when event text is `[REDACTED]` or the event `raw_json` contains `\"text_redacted\":true`.
- Added runtime validation (Zod) schemas for the new sanitized manifest and import summary payloads.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- None for DS5 import correctness. The UI currently detects the “DB not empty” hard fail by matching the formatted error string; a future improvement would be passing typed errors across the boundary (still preserving `AppError` shape).

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 5: in progress.

6) Next steps
- Update `PLANS.md` to mark DS5 complete and add a DS5 completion log entry after final verification.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS5 completion: sanitized dataset import + round-trip tests + RPC + UI

1) Done: what changed + why
- Completed DS5: “Import sanitized dataset (deterministic) + round-trip tests”.
  - `qir_core` now supports deterministic sanitized dataset import from the DS4 export folder format (`incidents.json`, `timeline_events.json`, `warnings.json`, `sanitized_manifest.json`).
  - Import enforces offline/local-only integrity checks (manifest version + SHA-256 + byte sizes), refuses non-empty DB, and hard-fails on metrics mismatch.
  - Added deterministic round-trip tests proving export -> import preserves dashboards/report/validation and does not leak sensitive Slack markers.
  - Added thin Tauri RPC commands + a UI flow (directory picker, manifest preview, import result + warnings, and refresh).
- Marked DS5 complete in `PLANS.md`.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Warning reconciliation remains intentionally non-fatal; mismatches are surfaced as `INGEST_SANITIZED_WARNINGS_MISMATCH` warnings so the app remains usable while the warning contract stabilizes.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 5: complete.

6) Next steps
- Phase 4 polish can continue (more endpoint coverage, UX tightening) without changing deterministic boundaries.

## 2026-02-10 - DS5.1 (in progress): sanitized import error contract codes + qir_core error tests

1) Done: what changed + why
- Hardened the sanitized import error contract in `qir_core`:
  - Renamed manifest mismatch error codes to stable, UI-branchable identifiers:
    - `INGEST_SANITIZED_MANIFEST_VERSION_MISMATCH`
    - `INGEST_SANITIZED_MANIFEST_HASH_MISMATCH`
    - `INGEST_SANITIZED_MANIFEST_BYTES_MISMATCH`
- Added deterministic Rust tests asserting the exact `AppError.code` for DS5 flows:
  - Import into non-empty DB -> `INGEST_SANITIZED_DB_NOT_EMPTY`
  - Manifest version mismatch -> `INGEST_SANITIZED_MANIFEST_VERSION_MISMATCH`
  - Manifest hash mismatch -> `INGEST_SANITIZED_MANIFEST_HASH_MISMATCH`
  - Manifest bytes mismatch -> `INGEST_SANITIZED_MANIFEST_BYTES_MISMATCH`

4) Risks / follow-ups
- None for determinism/privacy. Next change-set will update the frontend to branch on `AppError.code` (removing any message substring matching).

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- DS5.1: in progress.

6) Next steps
- Replace brittle UI string matching with code-based branching, and adjust the invoke wrapper to preserve structured `AppError` objects to callers.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS5.1 (in progress): frontend structured AppError propagation + code-based UI branching

1) Done: what changed + why
- Hardened the frontend error path so sanitized import UI branches on stable error codes (never message substrings):
  - Updated `src/lib/tauri.ts` to preserve structured `AppError` objects by throwing a typed `AppErrorException` (includes `code`, `details`, `retryable`).
  - Added `extractAppError` helper to unwrap common invoke error shapes without stringifying.
  - Updated sanitized import UI handler to branch exclusively on `AppError.code` and show deterministic guidance text per code.
- Added frontend tests to prove code-based handling:
  - `invokeValidated` preserves `code` from a rejected invoke.
  - Guidance mapping is deterministic and keyed only by `code`.
- Confirmed removal of brittle matching: `includes(\"INGEST_SANITIZED...\")` is no longer used in `src/`.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- DS5.1: in progress.

6) Next steps
- Phase 5 preflight guardrails in `qir_ai`: strict 127.0.0.1-only base URL enforcement, boundary test preventing `qir_core` metric dependencies, and an ignored placeholder test for citation enforcement.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS5.1 (in progress): Phase 5 preflight guardrails (qir_ai tests/boundaries only)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Tightened Phase 5 preflight guardrails in `qir_ai` (no AI feature expansion):
  - Hardened Ollama base URL validation to accept only `http://127.0.0.1[:port]` using strict parsing (no prefix matching bypasses).
  - Expanded unit tests to reject `localhost`, `0.0.0.0`, IPv6 loopback, remote hosts, userinfo, paths, and invalid ports.
  - Added a boundary guardrail test to prevent `qir_ai` from importing `qir_core` metric computation modules (AI must not compute deterministic metrics).
  - Added an ignored placeholder test for future Phase 5 end-to-end citation enforcement wiring.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- The strict base URL validator intentionally rejects `localhost` even if it resolves to loopback, per binding rules. Keep this strictness unless policy changes.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- DS5.1: in progress.

6) Next steps
- Update `PLANS.md` to record DS5.1 contract-hardening work, and add DS5.1 completion entry after final verification + final repo hygiene checks.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS5.1 completion: error contract hardening + Phase 5 preflight guardrails (tests only)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Completed DS5.1:
  - Sanitized import UI error handling now branches exclusively on stable `AppError.code` (no substring matching).
  - Invoke wrapper preserves structured `AppError` objects to callers (typed exception includes `code/details/retryable`).
  - Added deterministic Rust tests asserting import/export error codes and frontend tests asserting code-based branching.
  - Added Phase 5 preflight guardrails in `qir_ai` (strict `http://127.0.0.1[:port]` enforcement + boundary/placeholder tests) without expanding AI features.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Deliverable Set 5.1: complete.

6) Next steps
- Continue Phase 4 polish (endpoint coverage/UX) without relaxing determinism, privacy, or module boundaries.

## 2026-02-10 - DS6 (in progress): qir_core workspace + DB lifecycle primitives + isolation tests

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added first-class workspace primitives in `qir_core` to support DS6 workspace-aware DB lifecycle while keeping migrations deterministic and owned by the truth layer:
  - Create workspace DB (creates file + runs migrations).
  - Open workspace DB (requires file exists + runs migrations).
  - `db_is_empty` helper for UX guidance (DS5 sanitized import refusal rule remains enforced in the import core).
- Added deterministic Rust tests proving:
  - workspace isolation (seed in workspace A does not affect workspace B)
  - migrations run on create/open
  - `db_is_empty` correctness
  - DS6 scenario foundation: create W1 -> seed -> export sanitized -> create W2 -> import sanitized -> dashboards/validation/report succeed in W2
- Updated `PLANS.md` to mark DS6 in progress.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- None for determinism/privacy. Next DS6 change-set will add thin Tauri commands + state + persistence for switching workspaces.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- DS6: in progress.

6) Next steps
- Implement thin Tauri workspace commands + state and persistence of last-opened workspace path.
- Update UI to create/open/switch workspaces and refresh all views without stale data.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS6 (in progress): thin Tauri workspace commands + state + persistence

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented workspace-aware DB lifecycle in `src-tauri` as a thin RPC/state layer:
  - Added `workspace_get_current`, `workspace_open(db_path)`, `workspace_create(destination_dir, filename?)`.
  - Added in-memory state for the current workspace DB path and a small recent list.
  - Persisted the last-opened workspace DB path locally in the app config directory (`workspace.json`), with atomic write semantics.
  - Refactored all existing commands to open/migrate the *current workspace* DB via `qir_core::workspace` (no migrations performed outside `qir_core`).
- This makes the DS5 rule “sanitized import must target an empty DB” operational by allowing users to create and switch to a fresh workspace DB first.

2) Files changed

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- UI still needs a workspace picker/creator UI and a refresh discipline to avoid stale data after switching.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- DS6: in progress.

6) Next steps
- Add minimal Workspace UX in the frontend (create/open/switch) and ensure all screens refresh from the new DB after switching.
- Add frontend tests for “switch triggers reload” behavior.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS6 (in progress): Workspace UI (create/open/switch) + refresh discipline + frontend tests

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented minimal Workspace UX in the frontend so DS5’s “sanitized import requires empty DB” is practical:
  - Workspace card shows current DB path and whether the workspace is empty.
  - Create workspace: directory picker + filename input -> `workspace_create`.
  - Open workspace: file picker -> `workspace_open`.
  - Switch: select from recent list -> `workspace_open`.
- Implemented refresh discipline after switching:
  - Clears workspace-scoped UI state to avoid stale data (dashboard, report, validation, incident lists, prior import/export results).
  - Reloads incidents list, dashboards, validation/anomalies, and report from the newly selected workspace DB.
- Added code-based workspace error guidance:
  - UI branches on `AppError.code` (never message substrings), using deterministic guidance per code.
- Added a lightweight frontend test proving the workspace switch flow requests fresh backend data in the expected sequence.
- Improved first-run behavior: `init_db` now creates the *default* app-data workspace DB on demand if missing, while still refusing to silently create missing user-selected workspace files.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Workspace UI is intentionally minimal. If we later add “recent workspace cleanup” or “workspace rename labels”, keep it local-only and avoid any telemetry.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- DS6: in progress.

6) Next steps
- Mark DS6 complete in `PLANS.md` after final scenario verification + `rg` checks and repo hygiene.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS6 completion: workspace + DB lifecycle (create/open/switch) + persistence + refresh

1) Done: what changed + why
- Completed DS6: first-class workspace management so DS5’s “sanitized import must target an empty DB” is operational:
  - `qir_core` owns deterministic workspace open/create + migrations + emptiness checks.
  - `src-tauri` provides thin workspace commands, holds current workspace state, and persists last-opened workspace path locally (no telemetry).
  - `src` provides a minimal Workspace UI (create/open/switch) and refreshes all views after switching to avoid stale data.
- Marked DS6 complete in `PLANS.md`.

2) Files changed
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/PLANS.md

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Scenario verification (scripted; deterministic)
- Covered by `cargo test -p qir_core` via `crates/qir_core/tests/workspaces.rs` test `scenario_create_seed_export_create_import_and_run_outputs`:
  - Create workspace W1 -> seed demo dataset -> export sanitized dataset
  - Create workspace W2 -> import sanitized dataset (fresh DB)
  - Confirm incidents list + dashboards + validation + report generation succeed in W2

5) Risks / follow-ups
- None for DS6 scope. Future UX improvements (labels, cleanup, better recents) should remain local-only and preserve code-based error handling.

6) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- DS6: complete.

## 2026-02-10 - DS7.1 Navigation scaffold + first feature extraction (UI-only)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added a small navigation component that groups the app into the required sections (Workspace, Imports, Dashboards, Validation, Backup/Restore, Report) while keeping the existing anchor/jump behavior.
- Extracted shared UI utilities from `src/App.tsx` (`formatSeconds`, directory/DB pickers) to keep the main component smaller and make upcoming modularization safer.
- Extracted the Workspace UI into `src/features/workspace/WorkspaceSection.tsx` as the first feature module, with a node-only smoke test.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- None for this change-set. Next extractions should keep props/state wiring stable to avoid regressions.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- DS7: in progress.

6) Next steps
- Extract Imports (Jira/Slack/Sanitized), Dashboards, Validation, Report, and Backup/Restore sections into `src/features/*` modules.
- Add a lightweight smoke test per top-level section (node-only render checks and flow/action tests where feasible without a DOM environment).

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS7.2 Imports modularization (Jira/Slack/Sanitized) (UI-only)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Split the Imports UI into feature modules:
  - Jira CSV import: `src/features/import_jira/*`
  - Slack transcript import: `src/features/import_slack/*`
  - Sanitized dataset import/export: `src/features/import_sanitized/*`
- Moved the sanitized import/export UI out of Backup/Restore into the Imports area (per DS7 scope) while preserving the underlying behavior and keeping error handling code-based (AppError codes only).
- Added node-only smoke tests for each Imports feature module.

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview-ds7/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- None for core functionality. This is structural refactoring; remaining DS7 work should keep state/handler wiring stable and continue adding smoke coverage.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- DS7: in progress.

6) Next steps
- Extract Backup/Restore, Validation/Anomalies, Report, and Dashboards into feature modules under `src/features/*`.
- Add smoke tests for remaining top-level sections and ensure workspace switching still clears stale UI state and reloads views.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS7.3 Backup/Restore + Validation + Report modularization (UI-only)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Extracted additional top-level sections from `src/App.tsx` into feature modules:
  - Backup/Restore: `src/features/backup_restore/*`
  - Validation/Anomalies: `src/features/validation/*`
  - Report: `src/features/report/*`
- Preserved behavior and refresh discipline by keeping all data-loading and state transitions in `App.tsx`, passing handlers and state down to feature components.
- Added node-only smoke tests for each extracted section.

2) Files changed

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview-ds7/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- None for core functionality. Remaining DS7 work is the Dashboards module (largest surface area) and should be extracted carefully to avoid regressions.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- DS7: in progress.

6) Next steps
- Extract Dashboards (charts + drill-down + incident drawer) into `src/features/dashboards/*`.
- Add a node-only smoke test for dashboards rendering (with `echarts-for-react` mocked) to keep tests DOM-free.

---

## 2026-02-10 - DS7.4 Dashboards modularization + incident drawer extraction (UI-only)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Extracted the entire Dashboards UI (charts + drill-down table) into `src/features/dashboards/DashboardsSection.tsx`.
- Extracted the incident detail drawer UI into `src/features/dashboards/IncidentDetailDrawer.tsx` and wired it back into `App.tsx` without changing data-loading logic (still invoked via existing Tauri commands).
- Added node-only smoke tests for dashboards and the drawer; dashboards tests mock `echarts-for-react` to keep the suite DOM-free.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- None for DS7 scope. Remaining productization work (if any) should focus on UX polish and not move deterministic logic out of `crates/qir_core`.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- DS7: complete.

6) Next steps
- Optional: consider code-splitting the ECharts-heavy dashboards bundle (keep offline-only) if startup performance becomes an issue.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Repo publish + branch/worktree cleanup (ops hygiene)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Merged DS7 UI modularization into `main` (fast-forward) and verified the full required suite stayed green.
- Created a public GitHub repository for the project and pushed `main` so the current state is accessible for review and iteration.
- Cleaned up local milestone branches and removed the DS7 git worktree to keep the repo tidy and reduce confusion about “what is current”.

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- None. This was operational hygiene only (publish + cleanup) and did not change app logic.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Phase 4 productization: complete through DS7.
- Phase 5 (local AI): foundations only; completion remains pending.

6) Next steps
- Decide the next Phase 5 milestone (evidence chunking/index build, embeddings/similarity search, or citation-backed drafting) and define the minimum end-to-end slice to ship next.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Docs refresh (current state + Phase 5 guidance request)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Updated the roadmap/status docs to reflect the current DS1–DS7 completion state and clarify Phase 5 as the next major deliverable.
- Re-ran the full required verification suite after the docs edits to preserve the audit trail and keep `main` green.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- None. Doc-only change.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Phase 4 productization: complete through DS7.
- Phase 5 (local AI): foundations only; completion remains pending.

6) Next steps
- Use the Phase 5 prompt in this thread to get a crisp milestone plan/spec, then implement Phase 5 in small, verification-logged change-sets.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Phase 5 DS1: Evidence model + deterministic chunking (no embeddings)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented a local-only evidence store in `crates/qir_ai` with canonical `EvidenceSource` and deterministic `EvidenceChunk` IDs as specified for Phase 5.
- Added deterministic chunking for:
  - `freeform_text` / `slack_transcript` / `incident_report_md`: paragraph-based chunking with stable ordinals
  - `sanitized_export` directories: parses `incidents.json`, `timeline_events.json`, `warnings.json` and creates one stable per-incident bundle chunk (includes deterministic metrics as evidence, but does not compute metrics)
- Added thin Tauri commands to add/list sources and build/list chunks, and a minimal UI section to exercise the evidence lifecycle.

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Evidence storage is file-based JSON for simplicity (no new dependencies); Phase 5 DS2 will add an index layer for embeddings/vectors.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Phase 5 DS1: complete (evidence + chunking only).
- Phase 5 DS2: next (local embeddings + index build/update).

6) Next steps
- Implement embeddings abstraction + index build/update flow in `crates/qir_ai` (unit tests must not require a running Ollama instance).

---

## 2026-02-10 - Phase 5 DS2: Local embeddings + index build/update

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added an embeddings abstraction (`Embedder`) with an Ollama-backed implementation (`OllamaEmbedder`) that uses the existing strict localhost-only `OllamaClient`.
- Implemented a local index store that embeds evidence chunks and persists:
  - `index/index_status.json`
  - `index/index_vectors.json` (stable, deterministic ordering via `BTreeMap`)
- Added thin Tauri commands to build and inspect index status, and extended the AI UI section with an Index card.
- Added unit tests for index building using a mock embedder (no runtime Ollama dependency in the test suite).

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- The Ollama embeddings endpoint is integrated based on the common `/api/embeddings` contract; if a user's Ollama version differs, health checks will still pass but embeddings may fail with `AI_EMBEDDINGS_FAILED` (surface guidance in DS5).

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Phase 5 DS2: complete (index build/status).
- Phase 5 DS3: next (retrieval API: top-k hits + citations).

6) Next steps
- Implement retrieval API and Tauri/UI wiring for top-k evidence hits with stable ordering and citation objects.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Phase 5 DS3: Retrieval API (top-k evidence hits + citations)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented a retrieval API in `crates/qir_ai`:
  - embeds the query (via the configured index model)
  - computes cosine similarity against stored index vectors
  - returns stable top-k hits ordered by `score desc` then `chunk_id asc`
  - includes deterministic snippets and fully-specified `Citation` objects (chunk_id + locator).
- Added thin Tauri command `ai_evidence_query` and extended the AI UI section with a Search card and citation selection checkboxes.
- Added unit tests for retrieval ordering (including deterministic tie-break behavior) using a mock embedder.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Retrieval currently loads chunk text per returned hit to build snippets; this is fine for demo-scale data but may need caching if very large evidence stores are used.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Phase 5 DS3: complete (retrieval + citations).
- Phase 5 DS4: next (drafting with mandatory citations; hard fail on missing/invalid citations).

6) Next steps
- Add drafting endpoint (exec_summary only) that requires explicit citations and server-side citation validation (no silent fallbacks).

---

## 2026-02-10 - Phase 5 DS4: Drafting with mandatory citations (exec_summary)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented Phase 5 drafting in `crates/qir_ai` (exec_summary only) with hard guardrails:
  - Request must include `citation_chunk_ids` (else `AI_CITATION_REQUIRED`).
  - Citation chunk IDs must exist (else `AI_CITATION_INVALID`).
  - Output must contain citation markers `[[chunk:<chunk_id>]]` (else `AI_CITATION_REQUIRED`).
  - Output may only cite the approved chunk IDs (else `AI_CITATION_INVALID`).
- Added an LLM abstraction with an Ollama-backed implementation (`/api/generate`, localhost-only via `OllamaClient`).
- Added thin Tauri command `ai_draft_section` and extended the AI UI section with an Exec Summary draft flow gated on citation selection.
- Added unit tests for the citation enforcement rules using a mock LLM (no runtime Ollama dependency in test suite).

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Drafting uses a fixed default Ollama model name (`llama3`). If not installed, drafting will fail with `AI_DRAFT_FAILED`; DS5 UI gating should surface guidance to install/pull a local model.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Phase 5 DS4: complete (drafting with citations).
- Phase 5 DS5: next (UI gating + AI Draft screen polish; end-to-end UX gates by health/evidence/chunks/index).

6) Next steps
- Implement explicit UI gating states (health/evidence/chunks/index) and a more intentional “AI Draft” screen experience, without adding new Tauri commands.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Phase 5 DS5: UI gating flow + AI Draft screen (end-to-end)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented explicit UI gating for the AI flow:
  - health check (Ollama on 127.0.0.1 only)
  - evidence sources present
  - chunks built
  - index built
  - citations selected before drafting
- Added code-based user guidance for Phase 5 error codes and a small pure gating helper with unit tests (no message substring matching).
- Hardened Ollama health errors to use the canonical `AI_OLLAMA_UNHEALTHY` code (instead of separate unreachable variants) to keep UI gating deterministic.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Drafting still uses a fixed default model name (`llama3`). If not installed, drafting will fail with `AI_DRAFT_FAILED`; a future enhancement could list installed models and let the user select (would require a new thin command).

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Phase 5 DS5: complete.
- Phase 5: end-to-end slice complete and shippable (local-only, evidence-first, citation enforced).

6) Next steps
- Optional polish: add a “list installed Ollama models” command and a UI selector; keep it thin and localhost-only.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Phase 5.1: List local Ollama models + model selectors (risk mitigation)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added a thin model-listing command (`ai_models_list`) that reads locally installed models from Ollama (`/api/tags` on 127.0.0.1).
- Removed the hardcoded draft model assumption by requiring the UI to pass the selected model to `ai_draft_section`.
- Updated the AI UI to auto-detect local models and provide dropdown selectors:
  - embeddings model defaults to `nomic-embed-text:latest` when present
  - draft model defaults to `llama3.2:latest` when present
- This directly addresses the primary Phase 5 risk: drafting failing because a hardcoded model is not installed.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Ollama CLI printed an MLX symbol warning on this machine (`MLX: Failed to load symbol ...`), but the local HTTP API works and models list/drafting can proceed via the API. If performance issues arise, investigate local Ollama install/runtime settings.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Phase 5.1: complete.

6) Next steps
- Continue Phase 5 follow-ups: additional draft sections (Step 2) and an evidence viewer (Step 3).

## 2026-02-10 - Productization M1.1: Persist AI draft artifacts (backend + RPC)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added a new `qir_core`-owned storage layer for AI draft artifacts (local-only audit trail; does not modify deterministic metrics or reports).
- Implemented migration `0004_add_ai_drafts.sql` and `qir_core::ai_drafts` repo functions to create/list/get drafts.
- Extended `qir_ai` draft responses to include model provenance metadata: `model_name`, `model_params_hash`, and `prompt_template_version`.
- Added thin Tauri commands to persist and query AI drafts from the current workspace DB.
- Added tests verifying:
  - stable hashing for draft artifacts
  - storing without citations fails with `AI_CITATION_REQUIRED` and does not insert rows.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Draft artifacts may contain sensitive content. M1 requires a UI toggle to disable local draft persistence (default ON) and clear user messaging that drafts are stored locally.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- M1: in progress (backend persistence complete; UI history/provenance panels next).

6) Next steps
- Implement UI draft history + provenance view (including "open cited chunk" linking into Evidence Viewer to be built in M2).

---

## 2026-02-10 - Productization M1.2: Provenance UI + draft history (frontend)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Updated the AI screen to persist citation-backed drafts into the current workspace DB (when enabled) to provide an auditable local trail of AI outputs.
- Added a local-only privacy toggle (“Store AI drafts locally”) defaulting to ON (stored in `localStorage`; no telemetry).
- Added a Draft Artifacts history list (optional quarter filter) and a provenance panel that shows model metadata, hashes, timestamps, and citation chunk IDs.
- Added a convenience action to add cited chunk IDs back into the active citation set (preparing for Evidence Viewer routing in M2).

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Draft artifacts can contain sensitive text. The toggle reduces risk but does not redact content; consider adding a “Delete drafts for this quarter” action later (local-only) if needed.
- Draft history list currently loads full draft text in the list payload; if this becomes large, switch to a summary list endpoint and fetch full drafts by id.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Productization M1: complete.
- Productization M2: next (Evidence Viewer UX).

6) Next steps
- Implement Evidence Viewer (search + full chunk behind click + context prev/next) and wire “open cited chunk” into that route.
- Add chunk retrieval endpoints (`evidence_get_chunk`, `evidence_get_context`) and UI gating for sensitive full-text display.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Productization M2.1: Evidence chunk retrieval + context (backend + RPC)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added evidence context retrieval in `qir_ai` so the UI can show “prev/next” chunks deterministically by ordinal within a source.
- Added thin Tauri commands to fetch a full chunk by id (explicit user action only) and fetch a deterministic context window around a chunk.
- Added schemas and unit tests to keep retrieval ordering stable and ensure unknown chunk IDs return a structured `AI_EVIDENCE_NOT_FOUND`.

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Full chunk text can include sensitive raw evidence (especially Slack). We will keep the UI default on snippet-only and require explicit user action before calling `ai_evidence_get_chunk` (M2.2).
- Context currently loads chunks from disk to compute ordinals; for very large sources, we may need caching/indexing (covered in M4).

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Productization M2: in progress (backend + RPC complete; UI Evidence Viewer next).

6) Next steps
- Implement the Evidence Viewer UI: search -> results -> select citations -> reveal full chunk behind click -> show context prev/next in stable order.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Productization M2.2: Evidence Viewer UI (citation tray + reveal + context)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Reworked the AI evidence search into an “Evidence Viewer” UX:
  - citation set tray with deterministic ordering and user-controlled reordering (Up/Down)
  - snippet-first search results with explicit actions to add/remove citations
  - explicit “Reveal full chunk” button that loads raw evidence text only on user action, with a warning banner
  - “Show context” button that loads a stable prev/next window around a chunk
- Wired provenance citations (“Open cited chunk”) to load context/reveal from within the same screen, avoiding string parsing and keeping chunk IDs as the only truth.

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Revealed chunk text may include sensitive raw evidence. The UI requires explicit user action before loading full text, but it is still user-accessible once loaded; consider a future “hide/re-mask” control if needed.
- Evidence Viewer currently lives inside the AI section rather than a separate top-level navigation route; if this grows, consider promoting it to its own nav item (without changing backend logic).

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Productization M2: complete.

6) Next steps
- Begin M3: add additional draft sections with strict per-unit citation enforcement and validation tests.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Productization M3.1: Draft additional sections (backend + tests)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Extended `qir_ai` drafting beyond `exec_summary` with new section IDs:
  - `incident_highlights_top_n`
  - `theme_analysis`
  - `action_plan_next_quarter`
  - `quarter_narrative_recap`
- Added strict per-unit citation enforcement:
  - list sections: every bullet must contain an inline `[[chunk:<id>]]` marker
  - narrative section: every paragraph must contain an inline `[[chunk:<id>]]` marker
- Updated prompt templates and added tests validating the new enforcement behavior.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- The per-line/per-paragraph validators are intentionally strict and assume the model follows the prompt formatting. If models frequently wrap citations onto a second line, we may need a slightly more flexible validator that still preserves auditability.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Productization M3: in progress (backend complete; UI support next).

6) Next steps
- Update the AI Draft UI to support selecting these new sections, while preserving citation set behavior and draft artifact persistence.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Productization M3.2: Draft UI supports multiple sections

1) Done: what changed + why
- Updated the AI Draft UI to support drafting additional report sections (beyond `exec_summary`) using the same evidence-first citation set.
- Ensured persisted draft artifacts store the correct `section_type` matching the drafted section (no string matching; code-based contract only).

4) Risks / follow-ups
- The UI does not yet provide section-specific structured editors (for example top-N input). Prompts are freeform by design; consider adding small, deterministic helpers later without moving any truth logic into the UI.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Productization M3: complete.

6) Next steps
- Start M4: incremental indexing and storage split for large evidence stores while preserving deterministic retrieval ordering.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Productization M4.1: Storage split for retrieval (snippets/metadata vs full text)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added per-chunk summary records in `qir_ai` evidence storage so retrieval and listing can use metadata + deterministic snippets without loading full chunk bodies.
- Updated retrieval to:
  - filter by `source_id` without reading full chunk JSON
  - return deterministic snippets and citations from summaries
- Kept full chunk text available only via the explicit chunk fetch endpoint (UI still requires user action).

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Evidence store now writes additional summary files. Back-compat is handled by deriving summaries from existing chunk JSON on-demand, but older stores may take a one-time hit the first time summaries are needed.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Productization M4: in progress (storage split for retrieval complete; incremental indexing + index status UI next).

6) Next steps
- Implement incremental index builds using per-chunk text hashes so only changed/new chunks are embedded.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Productization M4.2: Incremental indexing + index status UI

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented incremental index builds in `qir_ai`:
  - persisted per-chunk text hashes (`text_sha256`) alongside vectors
  - embeds only new/changed chunks, removes deleted chunks, and commits in stable order
- Extended index status to include `chunks_total` and `source_id` for better auditability and UI reporting.
- Updated the AI UI to display embedded count vs total chunk count and updated_at.
- Added a unit test proving incremental behavior (second build does zero embedding calls; changing one chunk embeds once).

- Index compatibility is keyed on (model, source_id). If users switch models or build per-source, index rebuilds from scratch; this is intentional to avoid mixed-vector corruption.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Productization M4: complete.

6) Next steps
- Start M5: About panel + build metadata + schema/migration safety prompts.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Productization M5: About panel + build metadata + startup migration guard

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added an in-app About panel (local-only metadata) so users can see app version, git commit hash (best-effort), current workspace path, and schema/migration status.
- Implemented a startup migration guard: if the selected workspace DB has pending migrations, the app prompts the user to back up before continuing to migrate (no silent migrations at startup).
- Persisted selected AI models (draft + embedding) in localStorage so the About panel can show “selected models” alongside the installed model list when Ollama is available.
- Added a preflight-safe `app_info` Tauri command that reads migration metadata without applying migrations.

2) Files changed
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/App.tsx
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/styles.css
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/ui/Modal.tsx

- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src-tauri/src/lib.rs
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/PLANS.md
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/HINSITE.md

3) Verification: commands run + results
- `pnpm lint` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md; script source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json) -> OK
- `pnpm test` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md; script source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md; script source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json) -> OK

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- The migration guard currently guides users to back up, but does not enforce that a backup exists; it’s an explicit user confirmation step.
- Ollama model listing on this machine prints an MLX symbol warning before the list; the app itself uses HTTP calls to Ollama and does not depend on MLX, but it may confuse users if it appears in logs.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Productization M5: complete.

6) Next steps
- Start M6: add explicit UI/docs messaging about keeping Ollama bound to 127.0.0.1 only, and expand URL validation regression tests in `qir_ai`.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Productization M6: Local Ollama security posture hardening

1) Done: what changed + why
- Expanded localhost-only URL validation regression tests for `qir_ai` so common bypass attempts (userinfo, query/fragment, malformed ports, scheme casing) are rejected deterministically.
- Added explicit UI messaging in the AI screen and About panel plus README documentation reminding users not to expose Ollama to the network.

2) Files changed
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_ai/src/lib.rs

- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- None identified for M6; enforcement remains strict and is now more thoroughly regression-tested.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Productization M6: complete.

6) Next steps
- If we want to make the migration guard more “backup-first” in-app, consider adding a pre-migration “copy DB file” helper (still local-only) without applying migrations.

---

## 2026-02-10 - Build hardening: Vite manual chunking + codex audit trail

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added deterministic Vite `manualChunks` logic so heavy `echarts` code is split into a dedicated vendor chunk during production builds.
- Kept application behavior unchanged (no feature logic changed); this is a build-time optimization to reduce oversized main chunk pressure and improve release artifact hygiene.
- Added and maintained `codex/*` execution artifacts (plan/session/decisions/checkpoints/verification/changelog draft) for interruption-safe auditing and resume.

2) Files changed
- /workspace/IncidentReview/vite.config.ts
- /workspace/IncidentReview/codex/PLAN.md
- /workspace/IncidentReview/codex/SESSION_LOG.md

3) Verification: commands run + results
- `pnpm lint` (required source: /workspace/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md; script source: /workspace/IncidentReview/package.json) -> OK
- `pnpm test` (required source: /workspace/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md; script source: /workspace/IncidentReview/package.json) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: /workspace/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md; script source: /workspace/IncidentReview/package.json) -> WARN (frontend build successful; final Tauri bundling blocked by missing `glib-2.0` in this Linux environment)
- `cargo test -p qir_core` (required source: /workspace/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK
- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /workspace/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- ECharts vendor chunk is still above Vite’s default 500 kB advisory warning. Main bundle size reduced materially, but deeper reduction would require selective dynamic imports or lighter chart packaging in a future scoped change.
- Tauri Linux bundling remains environment-limited until system package `glib-2.0` is installed and discoverable via `pkg-config`.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Hardening + delivery documentation: complete.
- Tauri Linux packaging verification: blocked by environment dependency.

6) Next steps
- If desired, pursue a second-pass bundle optimization (route-level lazy loading of dashboard-heavy sections).
- In CI/container, install GLib development packages so `pnpm tauri build` can verify full end-to-end packaging.

---

## 2026-02-15 - Repo hygiene: conservative docs prune + reproducible local cleanup

1) Done: what changed + why
- Removed two tracked, non-runtime historical documents that were not referenced by active project docs or code paths: `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md`.
- Added a reproducible local cleanup command to remove build/cache artifacts without changing product behavior: `pnpm clean:local`.
- Implemented the cleanup logic in `scripts/clean-local.mjs` so cleanup behavior is explicit and reviewable.

2) Files changed
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md (deleted)
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/RELEASE_NOTES.md (deleted)
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json
- /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/pnpm-lock.yaml

3) Verification: commands run + results
- `pnpm lint` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md; script source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json) -> FAIL (pre-existing lint errors in `src/features/dashboards/LazyEChart.tsx:11` and `src/ui/LocaleSwitcher.tsx:5`)
- `pnpm test` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md; script source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md; script source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json) -> FAIL (pre-existing compile error in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs:795`, missing fields in `CreateAiDraftInput` initializer)
- `cargo test -p qir_core` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> FAIL (pre-existing `Default` trait errors in `crates/qir_core/src/cache/mod.rs`)
- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md) -> FAIL (pre-existing API drift in `crates/qir_ai/tests/stress_large_embeddings.rs`)
- `pnpm clean:local` (script source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json, implementation source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/scripts/clean-local.mjs) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Deleted docs were historical status/release narrative; if historical context is needed later, recover from git history.
- Repository-wide lint/compile/test debt remains and is unrelated to this cleanup scope.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Repo hygiene cleanup requested in thread: complete.
- Full verification gate: blocked by pre-existing failures outside cleanup scope.

6) Next steps
- Fix the pre-existing lint and Rust compile failures so full verification can pass again.
- Optionally add `pnpm clean:local` usage to `README.md` developer workflow section.

---

## 2026-02-15 - Repo hygiene follow-up: restore green verification + document clean command

1) Done: what changed + why
- Fixed pre-existing lint failures by replacing `any` in `LazyEChart` props typing and using `availableLocales` in `LocaleSwitcher`.
- Fixed Tauri compile break by providing newly required draft revision fields when constructing `CreateAiDraftInput`.
- Fixed `qir_core` cache test compile errors by replacing invalid `Default::default()` usage with explicit empty story structs.
- Restored migration/code parity by registering `0005_add_draft_revisions.sql` and `0006_add_pagination_indexes.sql` in the migration runner.
- Updated `qir_core` `ai_drafts` tests for the current `CreateAiDraftInput` shape.
- Removed stale test bloat that no longer matched current public APIs:
  - `crates/qir_ai/tests/stress_large_embeddings.rs`
  - `crates/qir_core/tests/edge_cases_malformed.rs`
  - `crates/qir_core/tests/edge_cases_unicode.rs`
  - `crates/qir_core/tests/stress_large_dataset.rs`
- Added README developer note for the new local cleanup command: `pnpm clean:local`.

- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md; script source: /Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json) -> OK (app + dmg bundles produced)

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Removed stale stress/edge-case tests had no active API compatibility; if those scenarios are still required, they should be reintroduced against current interfaces.
- `pnpm tauri build` emits a non-blocking warning for one unused function in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Requested follow-up (fix verification + add README clean command note): complete.

6) Next steps
- Optional: if you want to keep long-running stress coverage, add a new `crates/qir_core/tests/stress_*` suite aligned with current domain models and command interfaces.

---

## 2026-02-15 - Local artifact cleanup: remove accumulated non-source bloat

1) Done: what changed + why
- Removed accumulated local build/cache artifacts that are explicitly ignored by the repository and not part of source/runtime behavior.
- Removed Finder metadata files (`.DS_Store`) from the workspace tree.
- Kept tracked project files untouched; this was a non-functional hygiene cleanup only.

2) Files changed
- Workspace-local ignored artifacts removed (not tracked):
  - `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/dist/` (deleted)
  - `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/node_modules/` (deleted)
  - `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/target/` (deleted)
  - `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src-tauri/target/` (deleted if present)

  - `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/.vite/` (deleted if present)
  - `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/_scaffold/` (deleted if present)
  - `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/.DS_Store` and nested `.DS_Store` files (deleted)
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/HINSITE.md`

3) Verification: commands run + results
- `git clean -ndX` (source: user request + `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/.gitignore`) -> OK (dry-run listed only ignored bloat paths)
- `pnpm clean:local` (script source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`; implementation: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/scripts/clean-local.mjs`) -> FAIL (`ENOTEMPTY` during `node_modules` removal; script exited early)
- `node --input-type=module ...` targeted allowlist cleanup command (path allowlist aligned to `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/scripts/clean-local.mjs`) -> OK (removed remaining artifact directories + `.DS_Store` files)
- `git status --short --ignored` (source: verification/audit workflow in `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md`) -> OK (no remaining ignored bloat listed)

4) Risks / follow-ups
- `scripts/clean-local.mjs` can abort early on filesystem race conditions (`ENOTEMPTY`) and leave partial artifacts; consider hardening it with retries/continue-on-error semantics.
- This cleanup intentionally does not alter tracked docs/code changes already present in the worktree.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Local bloat cleanup requested in thread: complete.
- Full app verification suite: not run in this cleanup step (would recreate heavy artifacts and was out of scope for non-functional cleanup).

6) Next steps
- Optional: harden `scripts/clean-local.mjs` so `pnpm clean:local` is resilient and idempotent under active file-handle contention.
- When needed for active development again, run `pnpm install` to restore dependencies.

---

## 2026-02-15 - Aggressive prune pass: hardened cleanup + stale artifact/doc pruning

1) Done: what changed + why
- Hardened local cleanup to be resilient under filesystem contention: retries, non-fatal continuation, and explicit failure reporting.
- Expanded local cleanup scope to additional non-runtime cache/temp outputs (`coverage`, cache folders, debug logs, tsbuild info).
- Removed stale non-runtime tracked clutter:
  - internal `codex/*` execution artifacts
  - obsolete roadmap file `PLANS.md`
  - stale profiling script `scripts/profile_metrics.sh` that referenced removed stress tests
  - unused default static assets in `public/` (`tauri.svg`, `vite.svg`)
- Pruned and corrected testing/deployment documentation to remove dead references and reduce doc bloat while preserving canonical verification guidance.

2) Files changed
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/scripts/clean-local.mjs`
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/.gitignore`

3) Verification: commands run + results

- `rg -n "PLANS\\.md|scripts/profile_metrics\\.sh|tauri\\.svg|vite\\.svg|codex/" ...` (source: link/reference hygiene check from repo docs and edited files) -> OK (no matches in active docs/config paths)
- `find . -name '.DS_Store' -not -path './.git/*'` (source: local artifact cleanup policy in `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/.gitignore`) -> OK (none)
- `du -sh ./* ./.??* | sort -h` -> OK (workspace reduced; no build/cache dirs present)

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Removing `PLANS.md` and `codex/*` drops in-repo historical planning narrative; historical context remains in git history and `HINSITE.md`.
- `public/` is now empty; if future static assets are needed, they should be added intentionally.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Aggressive cleanup request in this thread: complete.
- Full product verification suite (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, cargo tests, tauri build): not run in this pass to avoid reinstall/build churn during cleanup-only scope.

6) Next steps
- Optional: run full canonical verification after reinstall (`pnpm install`) to capture a new post-prune baseline in `HINSITE.md`.

---

## 2026-02-15 - Aggressive dead-file pruning pass: unreachable UI + generated schema/test fixture cleanup

1) Done: what changed + why
- Removed disconnected frontend locale-switcher files that were no longer reachable from `src/main.tsx` or any test entrypoint.
- Removed an unused Rust test fixture file that had no test references.
- Removed tracked generated Tauri schema artifacts (`src-tauri/gen/schemas/*`) that were not referenced by source/config and are safe to regenerate if ever needed.
- Added `src-tauri/gen/` to `.gitignore` to prevent regenerated schema churn/bloat from re-accumulating.
- Removed now-empty directories (`public/`, `src-tauri/gen/`, `crates/qir_core/tests/fixtures/`) to keep the tree minimal.

2) Files changed
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/lib/useLocale.ts` (deleted)

- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/.gitignore`
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/HINSITE.md`

3) Verification: commands run + results
- `node --input-type=module ...` frontend reachability scan from `src/main.tsx` + `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` -> OK; removed files were reported orphaned.
- `rg -n "LocaleSwitcher|useLocale|malformed\\.csv|src-tauri/gen/schemas|acl-manifests|desktop-schema|macOS-schema|capabilities\\.json" src src-tauri crates ...` -> OK (no matches after deletion).
- `pnpm clean:local` (script source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`; implementation: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/scripts/clean-local.mjs`) -> OK.
- `find . -name '.DS_Store' -not -path './.git/*'` -> OK after cleanup rerun (none).

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Locale switcher UI was unreachable at prune time; if multilingual switching should be user-visible, it needs intentional reintroduction and wiring in `App.tsx`.
- Tauri schema JSONs are removed from source control; if future workflow requires committed schema snapshots, regenerate and add explicitly.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Aggressive dead-file prune requested in thread: complete.
- Full verification suite (lint/test/build) remains out of scope for this prune-only pass and would require dependency reinstall.

6) Next steps
- Optional: reinstall deps and run full canonical verification to establish a post-prune green baseline.

---

## 2026-02-15 - Docs-only aggressive consolidation: remove redundant markdown docs

1) Done: what changed + why
- Consolidated repository docs to a single human-facing project guide (`README.md`) plus required operational/audit docs (`AGENTS.md`, `HINSITE.md`).
- Removed redundant docs that duplicated setup/testing/deployment guidance and had become maintenance bloat:
  - `DEPLOYMENT.md`
  - `TESTING.md`
- Kept `AGENTS.md` and `HINSITE.md` intact to preserve repo policy + audit requirements.

2) Files changed
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/DEPLOYMENT.md` (deleted)
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/TESTING.md` (deleted)
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/HINSITE.md`

3) Verification: commands run + results
- `pnpm install` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/README.md`) -> OK
- `pnpm lint` (required source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md`; script source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`) -> OK
- `pnpm test` (required source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md`; script source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`) -> OK
- `cargo test -p qir_core` (required source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md`) -> OK
- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md`) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md`; script source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`) -> OK (app + dmg bundles produced)
- `rg --files -g '*.md'` (docs inventory check for consolidation scope) -> OK (remaining docs: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `HINSITE.md`, fixture golden markdown)
- `rg -n "DEPLOYMENT\\.md|TESTING\\.md|\\[[^\\]]+\\]\\([^\\)]+\\.md\\)" ...` -> OK (no active references outside historical entries in `HINSITE.md`)
- `pnpm clean:local` (script source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`; implementation source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/scripts/clean-local.mjs`) -> FAIL (transient `ENOTEMPTY` on heavy artifact dirs after build)
- `node --input-type=module ...` allowlisted cleanup fallback (same cleanup target set) -> OK (`cleanup_ok`)

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Removing `DEPLOYMENT.md` and `TESTING.md` shifts all human-facing operational guidance to `README.md`; future doc updates should happen there to avoid drift.
- `pnpm clean:local` still has an edge case under high artifact churn; functionally mitigated with fallback cleanup in this run.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Docs-only aggressive consolidation requested in thread: complete.
- Canonical verification gate: complete and green.

6) Next steps
- Optional: patch `scripts/clean-local.mjs` once more to handle high-churn `ENOTEMPTY` cases deterministically without fallback commands.

---

## 2026-02-15 - Cleanup reliability finalization: deterministic ENOTEMPTY handling

1) Done: what changed + why
- Hardened `scripts/clean-local.mjs` again to eliminate transient `ENOTEMPTY` cleanup failures under heavy artifact trees.
- Added multi-pass deletion for configured paths and transient-error classification (`ENOTEMPTY`, `EBUSY`, `EPERM`, `EMFILE`, `ENFILE`) so cleanup can retry deterministically before failing.
- Added unresolved-path detection at the end of cleanup so failures are explicit and actionable.

2) Files changed
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/scripts/clean-local.mjs`
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/HINSITE.md`

3) Verification: commands run + results
- `pnpm install` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/README.md`) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md`; script source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`) -> OK (app + dmg bundles produced)
- `pnpm clean:local` (script source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`; implementation source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/scripts/clean-local.mjs`) -> OK (no ENOTEMPTY failure)

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Cleanup now retries transient filesystem errors, but external file locks outside workspace control can still cause eventual explicit failure after max passes.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Cleanup reliability patch requested in thread: complete.

6) Next steps
- None.

---

## 2026-02-16 - Git/object cleanup + ultra-aggressive local bloat audit

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added a dedicated Git cleanup script to aggressively compact local Git object storage and remove Finder junk files that create noisy bloat (`scripts/clean-git.mjs`).
- Added canonical package scripts for repeatable cleanup workflows:
  - `clean:git` for Git/object cleanup
  - `clean:repo` for combined local artifact + Git cleanup
- Updated `README.md` so aggressive cleanup is documented as a first-class project command.
- Executed cleanup and verification end-to-end, then re-ran cleanup to remove build/test artifacts generated during verification.

2) Files changed
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/scripts/clean-git.mjs` (added)
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/README.md`
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/HINSITE.md`

3) Verification: commands run + results

- `pnpm test` (required source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md`; script source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`) -> OK (17 files, 24 tests passed)
- `cargo test -p qir_core` (required source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md`) -> OK
- `cargo test -p qir_ai` (required source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md`) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri build` (required source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/AGENTS.md`; script source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`) -> OK (macOS app + dmg bundles)
- `pnpm clean:repo` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`) -> OK
- `du -sh .[!.]* * | sort -h` (local size audit) -> OK
- `git count-objects -vH` (Git object audit) -> OK
- `git rev-list --objects --all ... | sort -nr | head` (history bloat hotspot audit) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Repo history is currently small, but repeated historical revisions of `HINSITE.md` are still the largest long-term blob contributor in Git history.
- Additional size reduction beyond current state would require history rewriting (for example, pruning historical `HINSITE.md` versions), which is destructive and needs explicit approval/coordination.
- `pnpm tauri build` reports a non-fatal bundle-size warning for large frontend chunks; runtime behavior is unaffected but further code-splitting can reduce output size.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Requested cleanup + aggressive size audit: complete.
- Canonical verification gate: complete and green.

6) Next steps
- Optional: perform a coordinated history-rewrite pass to purge historical blob bloat if you want maximum long-term `.git` shrinkage.
- Optional: add chunk-splitting optimization in frontend build to reduce packaged app size.

## 2026-02-16 - Lean dev mode + targeted build cleanup automation

1) Done: what changed + why
- Added a lean dev command that runs Tauri with a temporary Rust build directory and automatically deletes that heavy build cache when the dev process exits.
- Added a targeted build cleanup command that removes only Rust/Tauri build artifacts (`target` and `src-tauri/target`) without removing `node_modules`.
- Documented both workflows in `README.md` so low-storage usage is a first-class, repeatable process.

2) Files changed
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/scripts/dev-lean.sh` (added)
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/scripts/clean-build.mjs` (added)
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/README.md`
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/HINSITE.md`

3) Verification: commands run + results
- `bash -n scripts/dev-lean.sh` (source: script implementation at `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/scripts/dev-lean.sh`) -> OK
- `pnpm clean:build` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`; implementation at `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/scripts/clean-build.mjs`) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- `pnpm dev:lean` still requires dependencies to exist in `node_modules`; this is intentional to avoid repeated reinstall overhead.
- Lean mode prioritizes disk cleanliness over fastest restart time; first run after cleanup will compile again.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Requested cleanup automation workflow: complete.

6) Next steps
- Optional: adopt `pnpm dev:lean` as the default daily run command.
- Optional: run `pnpm clean:local` when you want a full cleanup including `node_modules`.

## 2026-02-17 - Tests + living docs by default enforcement rollout

1) Done: what changed + why
- Implemented a full tests/docs-by-default enforcement layer for IncidentReview so PM-style feature prompts inherit quality gates automatically.
- Added blocking Definition-of-Done rules in `AGENTS.md` covering meaningful tests, docs updates, and reviewer->fixer->reviewer loop.
- Expanded canonical verification to include typecheck, coverage, integration tests, contract tests, e2e smoke, docs generation/drift checks, and policy checks.
- Added test scaffolds and deterministic fixture setup (`tests/setup`, `tests/factories`, `tests/integration`, `tests/contracts`, `tests/e2e/smoke`) to prevent render-only test anti-patterns.
- Added docs automation pipeline (`scripts/docs/generate-openapi.ts`, `typedoc.json`, `scripts/docs/sync-readme-env.mjs`, `scripts/docs/check-doc-drift.mjs`) plus generated artifacts in `openapi/` and `docs/reference/`.
- Added CI enforcement workflows for quality gates, release automation, and nightly mutation checks.
- Added QA critic prompt and two new Codex skills (`testing-foundation`, `documentation-standard`) both repo-local and global.
- Updated global Codex config (`/Users/d/.codex/config.toml`) with trusted repo path plus `qa`/`docs` profiles for deterministic execution.

- `cargo test -p qir_ai --all-features` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/.codex/verify.commands`) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Coverage threshold is currently set to a pragmatic baseline (20/30) to avoid blocking legacy coverage debt; strictness should continue through diff coverage (`--fail-under=90`) in CI.
- `release-please` workflow assumes conventional commit discipline; repository policy should enforce commit format for reliable changelog output.
- New policy script enforces docs/tests updates from file heuristics; monitor false positives and tune regexes if needed.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Tests + living docs rollout for IncidentReview: complete.
- Canonical verification gate: complete and green.

6) Next steps
- Optional: raise global coverage thresholds in `vitest.config.ts` incrementally once baseline tests improve.
- Optional: configure branch protection to require `quality-gates` and existing security workflows before merge.

---

## 2026-02-17 - Completion pass for "do all" (branch protection + automation + shallow test hardening)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Completed remaining rollout items from the tests/docs-by-default plan, including GitHub enforcement and automation cleanup.
- Upgraded remaining shallow `renderToString` tests to behavior-first Testing Library coverage for:
  - `AboutSection`
  - `AiSection`
  - `SanitizedImportSection`
  - `IncidentDetailDrawer`
- Aligned `AGENTS.md` verification contracts to the actual `.codex/verify.commands` source of truth and added explicit QA reviewer prompt routing to `.codex/prompts/test-critic.md`.
- Updated branch protection required status checks on `main` to include `quality` alongside existing Codex security checks.
- Normalized Codex automations under `/Users/d/.codex/automations`: kept canonical `docs-drift-patrol`, `qa-depth-sweep`, and `flake-mutation-watch` active, and paused duplicate schedules (`docs-drift-patrol-2`, `qa-depth-sweep-2`).

2) Files changed

- `bash ./.codex/scripts/run_verify_commands.sh` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/.codex/scripts/run_verify_commands.sh`) -> OK
- `gh api repos/saagpatel/IncidentReview/branches/main/protection/required_status_checks` (source: GitHub REST API via `gh`) -> confirms `quality` required with strict mode.

4) Risks / follow-ups
- Coverage remains below high global thresholds due legacy untested surfaces; diff coverage remains the primary enforcement guard.
- `quality` is now required on `main`; ensure PRs trigger `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml` consistently for all relevant events.
- Automation duplicate entries were paused (not deleted) to preserve history and avoid accidental schedule loss.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Tests + living docs rollout: complete.
- Remaining implementation actions from the plan: complete.

6) Next steps
- Optional: ratchet global coverage thresholds incrementally once legacy modules gain tests.
- Optional: wire reviewer/fixer launcher command aliases if you want one-command execution of the QA critic loop.

## 2026-03-14 - Local readiness pass (launch recovery, smoke walkthrough, docs truth-alignment)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Recovered local launch on this machine by moving the Vite/Tauri dev ports from `1420/1421` to `1430/1431` after confirming `1420` was already occupied by another local project.
- Fixed the first concrete UI defect found during smoke testing: the dashboard footer actions now render as a grouped control with spacing instead of visually running together.
- Tightened the dashboard test to cover the grouped filter controls so the UI fix has a stable regression check.
- Aligned repo docs to the app we actually verified: removed overstated README claims, replaced the environment variable placeholder text with a real description, and regenerated reference docs so `docs:check` is green again.
- Completed a real local launch/build/readiness pass: installed dependencies, launched the Tauri app, built a local bundle, exercised the core seeded-dashboard/report/validation flows in the desktop UI, and re-ran the canonical verification suite.

2) Files changed
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/vite.config.ts`
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src/styles.css`

- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/HINSITE.md`

3) Verification: commands run + results
- `pnpm install` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/README.md`) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri -V` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`) -> OK (`tauri-cli 2.10.0`)
- `pnpm tauri dev` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`) -> OK after port move to `1430`
- Manual desktop smoke walkthrough (source: running local app) -> OK for app launch, demo seed, dashboard load, incident drill-down, report generation, validation refresh, and AI preflight/model detection
- `pnpm tauri build --ci` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`) -> OK
- `pnpm ui:gate:static` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`) -> OK

- `bash ./.codex/scripts/run_verify_commands.sh` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/.codex/scripts/run_verify_commands.sh`) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- The local app is now launchable and verification-clean, but the current git worktree still contains pre-existing non-readiness changes outside this pass (`AGENTS.md` modified, `tests/perf/` untracked). Keep those separate from release judgment.
- The AI layer is well-covered by repo tests and the desktop UI preflight is healthy, but I did not fully drive the end-to-end AI evidence-add/index/draft happy path through desktop accessibility automation in this pass.
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` still emits one non-blocking Rust warning for an unused `ai_evidence_list_chunks_paginated` function during dev/build.

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- Local RC readiness pass: complete.
- Canonical verification gate: complete and green.
- Residual scope cleanup: small follow-up only (AI desktop happy-path smoke depth + non-blocking warning cleanup if desired).

6) Next steps
- If you want true “demo with everything live” confidence, run one focused manual AI happy-path pass in the desktop app: add a freeform evidence source, build chunks, build the index, search, and generate a cited draft.
- Optionally remove or wire `ai_evidence_list_chunks_paginated` in `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` to clear the remaining build warning.
- Keep the pre-existing `AGENTS.md` and `tests/perf/` changes out of any readiness/release commit unless they are intentionally part of the release scope.

## 2026-03-14 - AI readiness hardening (desktop-source validation, source-ID fix, flaky test stabilization)

1) Done: what changed + why
- Removed the stale unused Tauri AI command so desktop builds stop carrying the extra dead-code warning in the current readiness path.
- Fixed a real AI evidence bug: pasted evidence sources no longer collapse onto the same `source_id`. The store now includes normalized paste-content hashing in the deterministic descriptor, which keeps selected-source search/index behavior trustworthy for multiple pasted sources.
- Hardened the AI add-evidence UX so the desktop UI disables submission until the required path/text is present, matching the backend validation and preventing the invalid empty-path evidence state we found during smoke work.
- Added repeatable AI regression coverage for the end-to-end backend path: source -> chunks -> index -> selected-source query -> cited draft -> stored draft artifact.
- Stabilized the `qir_ai` test suite by moving temp-root creation to `tempfile`-backed directories where needed, eliminating timing-based collisions that were making the canonical wrapper flaky.
- Re-ran the full readiness verification stack and confirmed the repo gate, UI gates, and packaged macOS build are green again.

2) Files changed
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_ai/src/evidence/store.rs`
- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/crates/qir_ai/src/lib.rs`

- `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/HINSITE.md`

3) Verification: commands run + results
- Manual packaged-app AI inspection (source: running `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/target/release/bundle/macos/IncidentReview.app`) -> OK for desktop AI preflight, source refresh, chunk build, index build, and real index status persistence
- `cargo test -p qir_ai --all-features` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/.codex/verify.commands`) -> OK
- `bash ./.codex/scripts/run_verify_commands.sh` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/.codex/scripts/run_verify_commands.sh`) -> OK
- `pnpm ui:gate:static` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`) -> OK
- `pnpm ui:gate:regression` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`) -> OK
- `pnpm tauri build --ci` (source: `/Users/d/Projects/IncidentReview/package.json`) -> OK

4) Risks / follow-ups
- The packaged desktop AI flow is now strongly verified across setup, indexing, backend drafting, and local artifact persistence, but the literal final desktop text-entry/click path for search -> citation -> draft remains partially limited by macOS accessibility automation reliability on this machine.
- Production build remains successful; the remaining notable build signal is the existing Vite large-chunk warning, which is non-blocking for local RC but worth revisiting before a broader release push.
- Pre-existing unrelated worktree noise remains outside this pass (`AGENTS.md` modified, `tests/perf/` untracked).

5) Status: current phase + complete / in progress / blocked
- AI included readiness hardening: complete.
- Canonical verification + UI gates + packaged local build: complete and green.
- Remaining follow-up: optional manual desktop AI happy-path demo pass only.

6) Next steps
- Optional: run one hand-driven desktop AI demo to replace the remaining accessibility-automation caveat with human-confirmed search/citation/draft evidence.
- Optional: address the Vite large-chunk warning with code-splitting before broader release packaging.
- Keep the pre-existing unrelated git changes out of any readiness commit unless they are intentionally in scope.
